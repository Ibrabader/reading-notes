# How to Web Scrape with Python
## Web Scraping
Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website,
which can save a huge amount of time and effort.
In this article, we will go through an easy example of how to automate downloading hundreds of files from the New York MTA. This is a great exercise for web scraping beginners who are looking to understand how to web scrape.
Web scraping can be slightly intimidating, so this tutorial will break down the process of how to go about the process.

### New York MTA Data
We will be downloading turnstile data from this site:
    
    http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html

Turnstile data is compiled every week from May 2010 to present, so hundreds of .txt files exist on the site.

**Below is a snippet of what some of the data looks like. Each date is a link to the .txt file that you can download.**

### Python Code

We start by importing the following libraries.

    import requests
    import urllib.request
    import time
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup


If the access was successful, you should see the following output:

Next we parse the html with BeautifulSoup so that we can work with a nicer, nested BeautifulSoup data structure. If you are interested in learning more about this library, check out the BeatifulSoup documentation.

  soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, “html.parser”)

We use the method .findAll to locate all of our <a> tags.

  soup.findAll('a')

This code gives us every line of code that has an <a> tag. The information that we are interested in starts on line 38 as seen below. That is, the very first text file is located in line 38, so we want to grab the rest of the text files located below.
