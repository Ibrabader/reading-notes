## nosql vs sql:

- Fill in the chart below  five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

| SQL                                                       | NoSQL                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------| -------------------------------------------- |
| Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)             | Non-Relational Database                      |
| The data represented as rows and columns in form of table | Represented as key-value pairs in a document |
| Predefined schema                                         | Dynamic schema                               |
| good fit for the complex query                            | are not good fit for complex queries         |
| Examples:  MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL     | Examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb|

### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

#### If the data is highly structured & the relations among the program entities are clearly defined.

### Give a real world example.**

####  Hospital management systemn. For ex: the appointment for a surgery, the relation between the patient and the doctor, the oppitment, the surgery room and the bill.

### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

####  Unstructured data.

### Give a real world example.**

####  Data from social media analysis and websites.

### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

####  NoSQL.

### Which type of database is best for scalability?**

####  SQL.

## sql vs nosql (Video):

### What does SQL stand for?**

-  query language.

### What is a realational database?**

- A collection of data that represented as set of feilds and records, separated on multiple tables. Those tables (entities) have a relations that connect them, these relations could he **[ (one-to-one || (one-to-many) || (many-to-many) ]**.

### What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

-  realational structure.

### What is a ‘schema’?**

- diagram that explains the whole Database, showing the entites and the columns and the relations between those entites.

**What is a NoSQL database?**

- It's a non-structural database to build to store lots of data in a very efficient way.

### Howo does it work?**

- A database contains a collections each one has a documents: looks more like JSON. You don't have to use the schema for the whole documents, they can be different.

### What is inside of a Mongo database?**

- Collections that contains documents.

### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

- NoSQL,since there's no schema apllies and there's no relations, it's more easy to add more and new data.

- Less relation merging, super and fast queries.

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

- Having duplicate data.
