# Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack:

# What is a ‘call’?**

* Call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

# How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?**

* It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.

# What does LIFO mean?**

* Last In, First Out, which basically means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

* Manipulate the object/array with their lengths.

# What is a ‘type error’?**

* Occurs when a misspelling found.

# What is a breakpoint?**

* It's simply a point in your code, could be a console or condition..etc, to check a block of code (Debugging).

# What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?**

* A way of reaching the breakpoint, it shows you the history of the code block that set above it. givs you details of what this block of code contained.
