# Structure web pages with HTML
- there are steps to creat a web page, just like anything else, and for structuring a web page is goeas like this: 

## **1- Create Your Wireframe**
- #### wire frame 
- Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

## How to make your Wireframe Good: 3 Key Principles

**The following points should be at the forefront of your mind when building your wireframe:**

###  Clarity

Your wireframe needs to answer the questions of what that site page is, what the user can do there, and if it satisfies their needs. Your wireframe is an aid for you to visualize the layout of your site page and ensure that the user’s most important questions are answered and goals are achievable without being distracted by more aesthetic considerations.

### Confidence

Ease of navigation through your site and clear calls-to-action increase user confidence in your brand. If your site page is unpredictable, or has buttons or boxes in unexpected places user confidence diminishes. A lot of this information can already be organized at the wireframing stage. Using familiar navigational processes and placing buttons in commonly-used and intuitive positions, user confidence will soar–and that’s before you’ve even gotten around to thinking about colors and styles.

### Simplicity is key

Too much information, copy, or links, can be distracting to the user and will have a detrimental affect on your users’ ability to achieve their goals. You want your users to be able to find their way through your site with as little extra ‘fluff’ as possible, to the elements that map to their most significant goals in a given context.

Your wireframe should be a visual guide to the framework of your site and how it will be navigated. Attractiveness at this stage is not a consideration. Once you’ve decided who your product or service is for, you can begin laying out the information they are looking for in an intuitive and natural way that is not only familiar to them as users of this kind of service, but that also guides them towards the conversion point or otherwise helps them to achieve their goals in the interaction. By presenting your information in this way, you are aligning both the business goals of your site with the needs of the customer.

## 2-  HTML basics
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

- HTML elements

- The main parts of our element are as follows:

    
    
    #### The opening tag: 
    This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.

    #### The closing tag:
     This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
    #### The content:
     This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
    The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

- just as any language, HTML has its own syntax and rules, check[this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) for more information an how to build your first web page.

## 3- Semantics in HTML

- In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

- in HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
