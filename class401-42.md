# Dunder Methods

## What Are Dunder Methods?

***In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores***

***These â€œdundersâ€ or â€œspecial methodsâ€ in Python are also sometimes called â€œmagic methods.â€***

    class LenSupport:
        def __len__(self):
            return 42

    >>> obj = LenSupport()
    >>> len(obj)
    42

## Special Methods and the Python Data Model

***This elegant design is known as the Python data model and lets developers tap into rich language features like sequences, iteration, operator overloading, attribute access, etc.***

***Pythonâ€™s data model as a powerful API you can interface with by implementing one or more dunder methods.***

## Enriching a Simple Account Class

***enrich a simple Python class with various dunder methods to unlock the following language features:***

* Initialization of new objects
* Object representation
* Enable iteration
* Operator overloading (comparison)
* Operator overloading (addition)
* Method invocation
* Context manager support (with statement)

### Object Initialization:

*Right upon starting my class I already need a special method. To construct account objects from the Account class I need a constructor:*

    class Account:
        """A simple account class"""

        def __init__(self, owner, amount=0):
            """
            This is the constructor that lets us create
            objects from this class
            """
            self.owner = owner
            self.amount = amount
            self._transactions = []

### Object Representation:

*Itâ€™s common practice in Python to provide a string representation of your object for the consumer of your class. There are two ways to do this using dunder methods:*

* __repr__: The â€œofficialâ€ string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of __repr__ is to be unambiguous.

* __str__: The â€œinformalâ€ or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.

        class Account:
            # ... (see above)

        def __repr__(self):
            return 'Account({!r}, {!r})'.format(self.owner, self.amount)

        def __str__(self):
            return 'Account of {} with starting amount: {}'.format(
                self.owner, self.amount)

### Iteration: 

*In order to iterate over our account object I need to add some transactions.*

    class Account:
        # ... (see above)

        def __len__(self):
            return len(self._transactions)

        def __getitem__(self, position):
            return self._transactions[position]

*To iterate over transactions in reversed order you can implement the __reversed__ special method:*

    def __reversed__(self):
        return self[::-1]

    >>> list(reversed(acc))
    [30, -20, 50, -10, 20]
