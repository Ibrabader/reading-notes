## A beginners Guide to Big O

* Big O Notation: describes performance of algorithm - specfially run time.

- O(1) :  always execute in  same time/space

- O(N) : Describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set

- 0(N^2) :  proportional to the square of its input size

- 0(2^N) : growth doubles with each data input

- 0(log N) : targets median, compares to target value, if higher/lower will take median up upper/lower limit.

## Logarithms : 

Logarithms are slightly trickier to explain , example:

- Binary search :  
- technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value.
