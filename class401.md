1.	What’s your perspective?
2.	Why are you doing this?
3.	Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
4.	Are you doing this for you?

## A beginners Guide to Big O

* Big O Notation: describes performance of algorithm - specfially run time.

- O(1) :  always execute in  same time/space

- O(N) : Describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set

- 0(N^2) :  proportional to the square of its input size

- 0(2^N) : growth doubles with each data input

- 0(log N) : targets median, compares to target value, if higher/lower will take median up upper/lower limit.

## Logarithms : 

Logarithms are slightly trickier to explain , example:

- Binary search :  
- technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value.

## Facts and Myths about Names and Values:
- Names refer to Values and the assignment is making the name refer to that value.
- Many names can refer to one value
- Names are reassigned independently.
- Values live until no references .
- Assignment never copies data and changes are visible through all names.
- Mutable aliasing but Immutable values can’t alias.
- Immutable values includes ints ,float ,strings,tuples.
- Changing ints : rebinding ,Changing a list :mutating .
- We can rebind lists like this : num=num+[7] 
- We can’t mutate an int because int is immutable .
- Mutable and Immutable are assigned the same so assignment is the same for all values but the aliasing can make it seem different 
- Names have no type and values have no scope
