#  Authentication:

## What is OAuth:

### What is OAuth?**

- A protocol allows authenticated access to their assets without sharing their passwords. Instead of share the users their passwords, this protocol works like an agent between the users and their information. 

## Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.

- like using netlify through github.
## How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?**

- The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.

- The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.

- The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.

- The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).

- If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.

- The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.

- The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).

- The user gives the approved access token to the first website.

- The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.

- The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.

- The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.

## What is OpenID?**

- It is security technologies for humans logging into machines.


## Authorization and Authentication flows:

## What is the difference between authorization and authentication?**

- Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

## What is Authorization Code Flow?**

- Regular web apps are server-side apps where the source code is not publicly exposed, they can use the Authorization Code Flow ,which exchanges an Authorization Code for a token.

## What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?**

- Public clients (e.g., native and single-page applications) request Access Tokens, some additional security concerns are posed that are not mitigated by the Authorization Code Flow alone.

## What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?**

- Intended for Public Clients, or applications which are unable to securely store Client Secrets.

## What is Client Credentials Flow?**

- With machine-to-machine (M2M) applications, such as CLIs, daemons, or services running on your back-end, the system authenticates and authorizes the app rather than a user.

## What is Device Authorization Flow?**

- Input-constrained devices that connect to the internet, rather than authenticate the user directly, the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device.

## What is Resource Owner Password Flow?**

- Though we do not recommend it, highly-trusted applications can use the Resource Owner Password Flow, which requests that users provide credentials (username and password), typically using an interactive form.
