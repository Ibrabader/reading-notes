# JavaScript

- **JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

## JavaScript Variables

- JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

`var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y; `

- From the example above, you can expect:

   -  x stores the value 5
   -  y stores the value 6
   -  z stores the value 11

- you can use ` const or let to define a variable`


### JavaScript Identifiers

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

   -  Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    - Names must begin with a letter
    - Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
    - Names are case sensitive (y  and Y are different variables)
    - Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
